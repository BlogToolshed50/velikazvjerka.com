No matter where you live, trying to find out about cancer support and treatment services can feel like navigating a foreign city with a crummy map.

But at the Canadian Cancer Society&#8217;s information service, information specialists rely on a unique tool to make the search easier &#8211; a computerized database listing approximately 7,000 community services Canadians can turn to for help close to home.

That information is gathered and kept up to date by a team of Canadian Cancer Society volunteers and staff throughout Canada.

&#8220;This collection of cancer-related services is unique in Canada,&#8221; says information specialist Jan MacVinnie. &#8220;Our callers appreciate being able to find the help they need close to home.&#8221;

The database covers a huge range of services including screening programs, treatment locations, support groups, smoking cessation programs, wigs, prostheses and programs such as music therapy.

The service is Canada&#8217;s toll-free bilingual source of cancer information. Trained and caring specialists provide information which helps newly diagnosed patients and their families understand their condition and act as informed members of their health-care team.
