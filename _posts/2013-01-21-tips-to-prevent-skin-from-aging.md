Facial skin is a delicate and fragile tissue, and gets easily damaged through various external agents. Our faces are the first indicator of our age, and therefore it is important to take care of various factors that can adversely affect our facial skin. Although aging is a natural and irreversible process, steps can be taken to delay its onset and severity.

Some of the ways to avoid skin wrinkles and skin damage are described below.

Sun-rays Protection – Sun-rays have a damaging effect on our skin with their ultraviolet components that can penetrate deep into skin tissues. Wearing a basic lotion while going out in the sun is a common precaution that can be taken if you are planning to stay longer outdoors. Traveling to hot countries is another time when precautions can be taken to avoid extreme exposures during midday.

Daily Regimen – An active life ensures health to all body parts, including our skin. Exercise has a positive impact on blood circulation and body metabolism. Play keeps us young, and there is some truth to this saying.

Diet and Food – Perhaps one of the most important regulators of our skin health is the quality and amount of food we eat. Enough fluid intake and a balanced diet rich in vitamins is a good barrier against premature aging.

Lifestyle Issues – Smoking and other such habits are said to harm the skin as well. If you think this could be the case, precautions must be taken to reduce the habit or engage in health activities.

Skin is a living and breathing tissue, and not a dead covering on our body. It needs regular care and maintenance in order to remain smooth, tight, and lively. Healthy habits like getting up early, outdoor activities, and healthy diet, along with special treatments with oils and moisturizers can keep our skin young and fresh for a longer time.
