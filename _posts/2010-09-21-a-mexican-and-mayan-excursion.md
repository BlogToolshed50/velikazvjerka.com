Every year I like taking a trip to Latin America to immerse myself in the Spanish language and enjoy the rich culture of that country. This past spring I decided to take a two week trip to Playa de Carmen, Mexico. The idea had come to me while watching my &nbsp;nfl cable package&nbsp;. I flew into &nbsp;Cancun&nbsp; where a driver from the language school I was staying at picked me up and transported me to the school. I stayed in the dorms for two week while I took Spanish language courses in the mornings.

Every day at lunch, I had free to explore the beach town and do whatever I wanted. Some days I would head to the beach and relax in the sand while working on my tan. I even got a massage on the beach once, which was a real treat. One of my favorite activities included walking down the main street, doing a little shopping. I was able to find Mayan and Mexican treasures for inexpensive prices.

One of the days I was there, I decided to go on an excursion to Sian Kaan. It was really amazing. It&#8217;s a Mayan nature preserve that has various activities to go do and see. I went on a water trip along the lagoon where we visited a temple dedicated to the Mayan crocodile god and ended the evening with a home cooked Mexican meal.
