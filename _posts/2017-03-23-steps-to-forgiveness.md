Have you ever been hurt by someone, yet found yourself unable to forgive that person for causing you pain? When the person who does the hurting is a close friend or loved one, you may feel especially betrayed. But in order to live a life filled with promise, success and joy, forgiveness is not only important, but it is also a necessity.

Forgiveness opens our consciousness to the inherent yet constant flow of universal love. By forgiving others, we experience compassion, we become non-judgmental, and we create unity by accepting others as they are.

In terms of karma, those who live according to an "eye-for-an-eye" philosophy create unhealthy patterns. For instance, let's say you have chosen to refrain from giving to others because you feel you are equally or more deserving. You are creating a self-fulfilling, cyclic pattern where you are not giving and you are not receiving. But on the other hand, when you forgive others who have not given to you, and become the true giving and loving person you are, you then heal this negative pattern.

Forgive others for what they have or have not done, for what they say or do not say, and realize we are all beings of love. But before you can forgive others, it is important to first forgive yourself for your own mistakes and accept yourself for who you are.

To help you in this quest for forgiveness, complete the following ritual daily:

- Sit in a quiet place and take few deep breaths
- Anoint yourself as mentioned below with your selected aromatherapy blend
- Take a few deep breaths again
- Say the appropriate affirmation below out loud three times
- Sit quiet for at least 10 minutes
