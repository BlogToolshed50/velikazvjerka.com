Anxiety disorders can have a devastating effect on those who suffer from them. Left untreated, anxiety disorders often inhibit an individualâ€™s ability to function normally in everyday life. Anxiety disorder may also be a source of additional tension caused by the strain the condition places on personal and professional relationships. Physical manifestations in the form of illness and mental manifestations in the form of depression are often the consequences of the intense and irrational worry that characterizes anxiety disorders While new methods of treatment are being developed, the most current form of medical care involves a combination of therapy to recognize and change the mental thought processes that make anxiety disorders possible along with medication designed to minimize the chemical imbalances that may facilitate these thought processes. There are several categories of anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, but the most commonly diagnosed is general anxiety disorder. 

Anxiety disorders can be difficult to diagnose as the symptoms associated with them are often shared by a variety of illnesses such as depression and chronic fatigue. In the past, physicians would frequently misdiagnose anxiety disorder by associating the symptoms with other illnesses while neglecting their underlying cause. This often resulted in treatments that were either ineffective or only served to inhibit the recurrences of specific symptoms. The end result of an improper diagnosis usually entailed an increase in other symptoms that were left untreated. 

Today, there are several resources on anxiety disorders and the symptoms associated with them. An increase in medical information available through the Internet has allowed individuals to obtain facts on the diseases and disorders they could potentially be suffering from. The ability to convey the presence of symptoms to your physician can help him or her provide a more accurate diagnosis of anxiety disorders. 

With proper treatment, anxiety disorder can be controlled. Many who have suffered from this affliction now lead healthy, productive lives as a result of their commitment to maintaining a well planned regimen.
