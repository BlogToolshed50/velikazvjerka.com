All skin types &#8211; normal, dry, and oily &#8211; needs to be moisturized in summer. Your face may appear to have a shine without a morning lotion, &#8220;but what you may be witnessing,&#8221; says Jacquie Hutchinson, national product trainer for Almay, &#8220;is a false sense of security.&#8221;

The skin, she says, has the life-sustaining role of protecting our veins, arteries, blood and organs from exposure to the environment. &#8220;It is such an important role that even with the first sign of dehydration, the oil glands immediately pump out more oil to protect from potential damage. Non-moisturized, dehydrated skin therefore can easily look oily and as a result it ruins that flawless, matte look you are trying to achieve.

&#8220;Instead, all skin types should be moisturized at least twice a day, but if you like, tuck-away the heavier cream for winter use and apply a lighter lotion in summer.&#8221;

For those of us concerned about applying too much product on oily or normal skin during the humid days of summer, specialists do suggest &#8220;the easiest solution is to get skin protecting and enhancing benefits, all in one.&#8221;
