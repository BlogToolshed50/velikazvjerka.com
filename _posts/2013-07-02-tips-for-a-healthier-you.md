We are all aware of the importance of living a healthy life. But what with the fast paced lives we all live in modern society it can sometimes be hard to balance that with a healthy lifestyle. Good health helps us achieve a high quality of life, we sometimes just need a little help to live it everyday.

Below are some tips to help you achieve a healthy way of living.

1. Exercise more. Make it a daily challenge to find ways to move your body. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean an hour of sweating it out at the gym, it could just be taking the stairs at work instead of the lift, walking the dog or mowing the grass. Exercising does not only improve your overall fitness it can also help in reducing stress.

2. Eat healthily. Avoid eating fatty foods, such as burgers, chips and pizzas. Aim to eat your recommended daily amounts of fruit and vegetables. If you can&#8217;t resist unhealthy food then remember a little in moderation is OK.

3. Reduce stress. Try to spend 30 minutes a day doing something you enjoy, for example, reading, walking,listening to music. Try to avoid difficult people where possible, and count to ten before losing your temper or getting annoyed.

4. Stop smoking. Apart from smoking being harmful to your health and those around you, smoking is about to be banned in all public indoor places in the UK as of July 2007. So there&#8217;s never been a better time to give up than now.

5. Protect yourself from pollution. If it&#8217;s impossible for you to live in a smog-free environment then at least avoid places where car fumes are high. If you spend your working week in a highly polluted area, then spend weekends where there is less pollution.

6. Enjoy a healthy sex life, try introducing Adult Toys into your relationship to spice things up. Don&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s also a great way of keeping fit too.

7. Avoid excessive drinking. While it has been reported recently that a glass of wine can protect against heart disease, that doesn&#8217;t mean drinking the whole bottle is beneficial too. Excessive drinking can lead to other health problems such as liver and kidney disease. Stick to the one glass and enjoy.

8. Stay positive. There is a definite connection between having a healthy lifestyle and having a cheery outlook on life. Life&#8217;s to short to get bogged down, learn to enjoy yourself.

9. Get a good nights sleep. Keep yourself busy during the day to enable a good nights sleep. Avoid drinking caffeine late in the day, and try not to nap in the day as this will through out your body clock making it even more difficult to get a good nights sleep.

With a few small changes to your daily lifestyle it is possible to lead a healthier life.
