Soil wealth preservation is a must sustain the agricultural production. The soil enrichment is made artificially by using chemical nutrient supplements. To maintain the soil wealth it is better that we use the Soil Inoculations. They are found to release the soil nutrients for the plant use to grow in a healthy manner.

These soil inoculates are nothing but the bacteria and few types of fungi incorporated into the soil to do this helpful job. By virtue of their symbiotic nature they are able to fix the atmospheric nitrogen as well. A type of bacteria called &#8220;rhizobacteria&#8221; which lives symbiotically in the root system of legume crops acts as the soil inoculate.

In the fungi side you can come across mycrorhizal which attach too many species of plants and facilitate the conduct of water and nutrients to the plants. The soil inoculates also help the plants to fight against certain pathogens causing diseases. They are helpful in warding of the diseases as they act as the antagonistic organisms against the plant pathogens.
