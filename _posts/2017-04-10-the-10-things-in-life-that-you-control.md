We humans spend much of our time trying to control every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, too often we waste time trying to control things that are simply beyond our control.

Having an understanding of what things you do control can make it easier for you to gain control of your life and everything in it.

#. What you do.

Your actions are yours alone. You choose to make them or not make them and you are responsible for the effects of those actions.

#. What you say.

Likewise, the words you speak (or write) are also consciously chosen. Like actions, they have an impact on your life and the lives of those you contact.

#. What you think. 

Yes, there are some subconscious thoughts that you can't control. But the things that you really think about, your beliefs, your ideals, etc. are concepts you have chosen to accept and believe in.

#. Your work.

Many people like to overlook this one, it being much easier to say "Oh, I'm trapped in my job because I don't have a degree, experience, etc."

Hogwash! That's simple a way of denying one's responsibility in having chosen the job in the first place. It's your job and you chose it. If you stay (or go), that's a choice as well.

#. The people you associate with.

There's a famous t-shirt that states: "It's hard to soar like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys." Colloquial is very often correct! Your friends can either lift you up or bring you down. You make the decision which type of friends you wish to have.

#. Your basic physical health. 

Much about our health is a factor of genetics, environment, and exposure. Much more of our health is simply a matter of the decisions we make about our health, such as: diet, exercise, drugs, sleep, routine physicals, check-ups, etc.

7. The environment you live in.

Your house, the condition of your home, the town you live in, the amenities available to you are all things you can control, although some to a lesser degree (i.e., you decide to tolerate them or move someplace else).

8. Your fiscal situation.

Having or not having enough money is a factor of what you make versus what you spend.

9. Your time. 

You choose how to "spend" your time and how much of your time to give to various activities. You'll never get more time than the 24 hours you're given each day.

10. Your legacy. 

All your actions, wordsPsychology Articles, and knowledge that you share while you are living become the gift that you leave when you are gone.
