Whenever a bank or a financial institution is coming across the bad loans especially in the mortgage loans, they try to sell the securities. These are called mortgage backed securities. They normally sell it in a bundle to other institutions who are willing to buy the same in order to improve the liquidity.

Once such mortgage backed securities are sold they are taken away from the balance sheet of the bank or the institution which had sold it. This cleans the balance sheet and offers the fund to recycle for loaning activity. The recent failure of so many banks under mortgage loans in the USA due to the failure of the people to repay the loan resulted in the sale of such bad loans

If the banks do not follow the basic ethics of extending the loans, the resultant bad loans leads to the liquidity crisis. Hence, the banks are bound to sell the mortgage backed securities at a discounted rate and raise the fund to lend further. In all mortgage creation protects the banks to minimize the extent of default.
