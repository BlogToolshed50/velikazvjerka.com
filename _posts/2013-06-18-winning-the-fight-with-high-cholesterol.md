There are more deaths caused by atherosclerosis in the US than by any other condition. Atherosclerosis is more commonly referred to as hardening of arteries. A major risk factor for atherosclerosis is a high blood level of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a form of fat that becomes deposited on the artery wall forming a plaque.

Cholesterol is, classified based on density:

Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol

LDL, also known as “bad” cholesterol is the most dangerous form. It is responsible for atherosclerotic plaque formation and growth in the arteries. Intermediate density (IDL) and Very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins are also other harmful forms, and are made up of varying combinations of cholesterol and triglycerides.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol

HDL, or “good” cholesterol, is a beneficial form that actually carries cholesterol away from the plaque to the liver. A higher level of HDL cholesterol, therefore, protects you from atherosclerosis.

Monitoring Cholesterol Levels

With the increasing awareness of the role that cholesterol levels play in heart disease, a routine inquiry into dietary habits is usually a part of most physical examinations. The American Heart Association recommends:

* cholesterol levels be measured routinely in all adults over 20 years of age
  
* risk factors for heart disease be evaluated at least every five years.

Risk Factors for Heart Disease

The most common risk factors include:

* age (men &#8211; more than 45, women &#8211; over 55 years or post-menopausal)
  
* hypertension (systolic 140 or greater, diastolic 90 or greater)
  
* diabetes
  
* smoking
  
* HDL below 35 mg./dl
  
* family history of coronary artery disease

The American Heart Association recommends a diet with less than 30% fat intake, less than 10% saturated fat, less than 300 mg./day of cholesterol &#8211; and weight control with regular physical activity as important preventive measures against heart disease.
