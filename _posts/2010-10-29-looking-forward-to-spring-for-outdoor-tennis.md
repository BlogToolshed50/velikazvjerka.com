Thanks for the guest post by Donn Schroeder

My best friend and I are always really excited when it warms up enough to go play tennis. It has to be our favorite time of the year, because as much as we appreciate indoor courts that allow us to play even in the dead of winter, there&#8217;s nothing like a fresh court with a cool breeze on one of the earliest spring days.

We&#8217;ve managed to develop a routine that gets us ready to go and out of the house. I pack a small lunch for us, with lots of water bottles, while she grabs the rackets, tennis balls, and a few towels. We load up the car together, set the &nbsp;Home Security Systems&nbsp;, and make our way to the courts. There are several courts near the house we &nbsp;rent&nbsp;, but we usually pick the courts at Ashinger Park, because they are spacious and are maintained the best.

Once we arrive at the courts, we drive around the park and see which area looks the best to play in. We&#8217;ll take into consideration whether or not there are kids playing nearby, as well as the position of the sun. After we&#8217;ve chosen the court that looks the best, we load up with our supplies and make our way to the court. Usually, we play three or four games before deciding to head back home.
