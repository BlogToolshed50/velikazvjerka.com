You have more options today than ever before when it comes to furnishing your child’s bedroom. You want the furniture to be attractive and interesting to your child. If possible, you should aim to have each piece match a particular theme.

Most important, though, you want to build or buy the pieces of furniture that are safest for your little one. Because their bedroom ought to be the room in which you feel most comfortable leaving them, follow these three steps to ensure the safety of your child:

Choose a reliable bed

Once you and your child have decided upon a theme for the room that adequately relates to their interests, find a bed that fits with the theme. Remember that you have a number of options when it comes to beds, as several local and online companies construct children’s beds. Whether you want your child’s bed to be a princess’ castle or a fire truck, all you have to do is take the time to find the right one.

The right bed will be one that is safe and durable. It should also be the right size for your child. If your child has just begun sleeping in a bed after leaving the crib, he or she will probably feel more comfortable in a bed that is low to the floor. Bed rails may also be necessary, as your child grows accustomed to his new sleeping environment.

Use dressers and drawers that are sturdy

Dressers and drawers are pieces of furniture have the potential to do the most damage to your child’s health. If a dresser is not sturdy, it may easily tip over. Every parent’s worst nightmare is the discovery that something significantly larger than their child is has fallen on top of them.

The best pieces are usually very bottom-heavy. A good test is whether you can tip it over with your knee or lower leg. The full force of your leg matches the strength of a strong toddler, so this is a very good way of determining if a piece of furniture is safe.

Most people agree that furniture made of wood is your best bet. Just make sure that it is polished and safe to touch. Avoid wood that appears to have the possibility for splinters.

Avoid toy boxes and other pieces of furniture that have unsafe locks

While you do want to have several places in which you can store your child’s toys, remember that children are adept at squeezing their little bodies into some of the tightest spaces. One of their great temptations is to climb into a toy box and close the lid.

It does not take much effort to imagine the many possible dangers of a box that locks. Make sure that all storage spaces can be easily opened – from both the outside and the inside. Again, fill your child’s room with bottom-heavy furniture so that nothing into which they climb will tip over.

Take into account your child’s activity level when decorating his room. Remember that even the most relaxed children will eventually have the urge to climb, so fill your child’s room with furniture that is low to the ground. Following these steps will help make your child’s bedroom a safe and fun place.
