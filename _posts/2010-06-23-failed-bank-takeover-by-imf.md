A recent newspaper article on take over of the failed banks in various countries by International Monetary Fund. It looks a pragmatic approach in the banking reform attempt. When many banks failed in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, many banks followed suit and declared bankruptcy siphoning the taxpayers money.

If the present proposal is implemented, the banks that fail may come under the management of the IMF which can deal with the matter unbiased. Since they take over by the local government leads to lots of political and official intervention in the conduct of the failed banks it is better they are controlled by IMF.

IMF take over of such sick banks may help them to enjoy the international expertise to ensure better regulation for healthy conduct of the business. By such take over the international participation in the cost is assured where as in the absence of the same, only domestic participation is observed. Anyhow, it is high time that such international organizations intervene to maintain the health of the failed banks to maintain the global economic stability.
