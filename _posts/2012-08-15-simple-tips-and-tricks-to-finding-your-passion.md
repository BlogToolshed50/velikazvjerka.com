Finding your passion or life&#8217;s purpose can at sometimes seem very difficult. What if we don&#8217;t have a driving passion for anything? If life seems less than passionate, don&#8217;t worry you&#8217;re not alone. Life doesn&#8217;t have to be mediocre, and even if you&#8217;re not passionate right now about something, with a little help you can spark an interest in something and quite possibly turn that interest into a passion. If you&#8217;re currently struggling to find your passion, here are several tips and tricks to get you going in the right direction.

Go back to your childhood. Remember when you were young and could entertain yourself for hours just day dreaming or playing silly games? It&#8217;s amazing how curious and wondrous we are as children, and how quickly we forget all the things we loved to do as a child. Revisiting your childhood can get you back in touch with something you once loved to do. Maybe you used to paint when you were little, and enjoyed it very much, but many years have passed since you&#8217;ve enjoyed those past times. Why not try doing something you used to love but no longer do. This could really ignite your passion and add meaning and fulfillment to your life.

Model someone who is passionate. A lot of times it&#8217;s a good idea to model the success of others. If there is someone you know who is passionate about something, why not try to model their behavior. If you look up to someone, or want to be more like someone, it&#8217;s ok to model their behavior so long as it&#8217;s moving you in the right direction. Sometimes it&#8217;s ok to fake it till you make it, eventually it won&#8217;t be fake anymore and you can become passionate in time.

Help someone. A lot of people are passionate about helping others. When we help someone we feel a sense of good, and a sense of purpose. Some people specifically like to help a certain group of people, like the elderly, or children, or at risk teens or immigrants. Generally speaking, people are good, and they want to feel good about what they do. Why not help someone and see how it feels. Maybe help a neighbor do their yard work, or cook a meal for someone elderly you know. You just might find a new found passion in helping people.

If you don&#8217;t already have a hobby or interest, go ahead and just try something. Maybe you always wanted to dance, but you felt goofy in front of others, or maybe you&#8217;ve always wanted to sing, but thought you had a bad voice &#8211; who cares! Why not go ahead and just try something, you might be really surprised at the outcome, you may find your passion doing something you were always too embarrassed to try before.

There are many ways to seek out your passion and find meaning in your life. These tips are designed to bring the passion out in anyone. You may be skeptical at first, but with some persistence you will find something that you can be passionate about. Sometimes we find that we have been passionate about something the whole time, we just needed to rediscover old pastimes and interests.
