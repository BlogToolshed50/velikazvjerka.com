Are you afraid to go to the dentist? Or does the thought of sitting still for long dental procedures make you anxious? Over 100 million Americans experience some form of dental fear, anxiety or even dental phobia &#8211; 100 million! So you are not alone.Sedation Dentistry has already helped millions of anxious patient get the dental care they need and desire without the anxiety and pain they usually feel about going to the dentist. Sedation dentistry can help! But first let us explain more about dental fear.

DENTAL ANXIETY is a reaction to a danger which is unknown, and the individual anticipates the worst even from relatively straightforward procedures. Anxiety is very usual, and most people experience some level of dental anxiety especially if they&#8217;re about to have something done which they&#8217;ve never experienced before. Mostly, it&#8217;s a fear of the unknown.
  
DENTAL FEAR is a reaction to a known danger, which involves a fight-or-flight response when confronted with the threatening stimulus: I know what the dentist is going to do, been there, done that &#8211; I&#8217;m scared!
  
DENTAL PHOBIA is basically the same as fear, only much stronger (&#8220;I know what happens when I go to the dentist &#8211; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going back if I can help it. I&#8217;m so terrified I feel sick&#8221;). Also, the fight-or-flight response occurs when just thinking about or being reminded of the threatening situation. Someone with a dental phobia will avoid dental care at all costs until either a physical problem or the psychological burden of the phobia becomes overwhelming.
  
One difficulty with defining dental phobia is that &#8220;dental anxiety&#8221;, which is a reaction to an unknown danger, may feel just as frightening as a &#8220;phobia&#8221; to a person, and they may well be defined (or define themselves) as phobic. From what little research there is available, this may be more common in people who are generally anxious. Also, even people, who&#8217;ve never had a bad experience with a dentist or a dental procedure, can develop dental fear or phobia &#8211; this is usually the result of vicarious learning (that is, scare-stories or media portrayal).
  
A person&#8217;s life can be affected widely by dental fear and anxiety. Not only does their dental health suffer, but dental phobia may lead to anxiety and depression. Depending on how obvious the damage is, the individual may not be able to take on jobs which involve extensive contact with the public. Loss of self-esteem over not being able to do something as &#8220;simple&#8221; as going to a dentist and intense feelings of guilt over not having looked after one&#8217;s teeth properly are also very common. Dental phobia sufferers may also refuse to see doctors for fear that they might want to have a look at their tongue or throat and suggest that a visit to a dentist might be in order.

Conscious Sedation in dentistry is defined as a minimally reduced level of consciousness that retains the patient&#8217;s ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway as well as awareness. Patient are completely unconscious, asleep, and unable to respond when they are under General Anesthesia. However, they are able to respond to conversations and breathe on their own when they are under Conscious Sedation. Also unlike General Anesthesia or I.V. sedation, Oral Conscious sedation does not need needles to administer and does not have the higher fees.

Oral Conscious Sedation protocols have been used safely on adults for over 30 years but were recently enhanced to improve the dental experience. There are no needles required to administer Oral Conscious Sedation and you will feel little or no discomfort once you are sedated.

Your doctor will review your medical history before starting any treatments and tell you how Oral Conscious Sedation can work for you. On the day of your Oral Conscious Sedation Dentist appointment, you will take the medication &#8211; a pill &#8211; and have a companion take you to your dentist&#8217;s office. Experienced clinical team members are with you during your entire visit to make certain that you are totally relaxed and comfortable and continue to monitor your comfort very closely throughout your therapy.
