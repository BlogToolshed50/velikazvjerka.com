Consumer durable Finance is encouraged in the banks and private financial institutions nowadays. When the spread has come down heavily on account of increase in the cost of funds this avenue helps the lenders to boost up the bottom line.

At the same time the recovery percentage in this sector is also at a reasonable level since the salaried class constitutes the borrowing comity. Since existing customers with good track record are funded under this schemes the rate of default is minimum.
