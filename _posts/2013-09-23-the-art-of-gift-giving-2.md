Gift giving has been a practice that has a place within the earliest recollection of human interaction. Throughout history, gifts or presents have been transferred from one to another in the form of goods, money, and even intangible items that one cannot touch, smell, or see, but feel in their heart, such as compassion or friendship. For some, the act of gift giving was rewarded with some form of power, social standing, and sometimes even a wife. Others have been purely satisfied with doing something nice for another and not receiving a thing in return.

One of the first memories of gift giving also shows a lesson in life, love, and sacrifice. Even in the book of Genesis, Cain and Abel gave gifts to God. Eventually, this tale would lead to one of the most known passages in the Bible regarding jealousy and murder. As the story goes, the gardener Cain gave fruit as a gift to God, while his brother, Abel offered the very best lamb from his flock. God was quite pleased with Abel&#8217;s gift, but not as impressed with Cain&#8217;s gesture. Since Abel chose to bestow a gift he valued for himself, God greatly appreciated the sacrifice. The same viewpoint on gift giving stands today.

For instance, if you took the time to travel many miles to a florist that produced the same bouquet of flowers for your parent&#8217;s wedding anniversary, this gift would mean much more to them than if you took the time to pick roses from the backyard. While the bouquet of flowers from the florist may look beautiful and smell just as sweet, the parents are probably more pleased by the sacrifice of driving such a distance to pay tribute to their anniversary with an unforgettable memory.

Sometimes, there are moments that do not call for the giving of gifts, but require a delicate, personal approach to the circumstances. For instance, when a friend is going through a divorce, they most likely would appreciate face-to-face comfort than receiving a gift in the mail from a long-distance friend. When this is not possible, there are still plenty of unique gift baskets on the market that can bring a smile to the most downtrodden individual.

For some, spending money on a gift may put a strain on their finances, but there are many great gifts that cost nothing at all or only require a few bucks. There are also a lot of gift givers who will accompany unique gift baskets and flowers with a present that took thousands of dollars to pull off. The average cost of a gift is hard to determine. The range really involves personal preferences and budget limitations. Many individuals have also found great gift savings through making purchases on the Internet.

For those trying to save a little money, the concept of re-gifting has been used. This usually occurs when one receives a gift that is not necessarily needed or wanted. It could be a silver serving dish that you already have or an unattractive sweater that you don&#8217;t have the heart to ask for an exchange receipt. In any case, you put the gift to good use by delivering it to someone else on a special occasion or holiday. If you make this a regular process, it is important to remember whom you received the original gift from (people have been known to re-gift back to the person who gave them the present in the first place).

Why Give a Gift?

Gifts satisfy an assortment of needs and beliefs. They are used to express a wide range of feelings, such as love, friendship, and gratitude. Gift giving may serve as a form of charity, as well as shows support (as seen in political arenas). Gifts also provide a way for people to celebrate a wealth of special occasions, customs, traditions, and holidays. Below, you will find some of the most important events that bring about the outpouring of gifts:

Birthdays

Gifts play an important role in celebrating the one day of the year you call your very own. The receipt of gifts and cards, as well as unique gift baskets and flowers for the ladies are common ways to make this personal holiday even more special. As one gets older, the gift giving seems to lessen, but the act is still a frequent occurrence for individuals of all ages.

Valentine&#8217;s Day

This romantic day for sweethearts often calls for the exchange of pink teddy bears, syrupy greeting cards, unique gift baskets filled with chocolates and scented candles, as well as colorful bouquets of flowers, such as bright red roses.

Christmas

Although most of the credit goes to Santa Claus for the gift giving that occurs during this holiday season, plenty of people have delivered unique flower bouquets of poinsettias, and selected beautifully decorated unique gift baskets filled with peppermint-flavored treats, red and green accented delights, and jingle bells.

Wedding

After attending the exchange of wedding vows, guests wine and dine at a ceremony where they bring gifts for the newly married couple. While monetary gifts serve as a tradition in many cultural circles, physical gifts, such as household goods and personal mementos are quite common.

When it comes time to give a gift, there are many other occasions that call for this type of exchange. People all over the globe mark their calendars each year to make sure they don&#8217;t miss gift-giving occasions.
