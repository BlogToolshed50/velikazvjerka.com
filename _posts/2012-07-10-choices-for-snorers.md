If snoring has become an issue in your personal life between you and your spouse, you may want to consider some lifestyle changes that may help with your snoring. Simple changes may be all that are needed to address your snoring, but if your weight is a problem, that may be the best place to start. A man even 20 percent overweight will be prone to snore.

For someone that is not overweight and snores, making healthy eating habit changes is likely to help. Eating smaller meals is one way to help. It is recommended not to eat meals that are high in fat and dairy late into the evening as they contribute to a blocked airway, which leads to snoring. Chocolate, fried foods and baked goods eaten near bedtime also contribute to throat blockage and the increased possibility of snoring. Drinking alcohol in the evening is known to relax the throat muscles and enlarge the fatty tissue in the throat, which constricts the airway and causes a high likelihood of snoring.

There have been studies that link the consumption of vitamin C with an increased possibility of snoring. Smoking is also a known contributor to the increased likelihood of snoring. Smoking creates mucous in the throat that will reduce airflow and bring on the higher possibility. Irritation in the throat caused by smoking is also a known factor in snoring.

There are foods you can enjoy that do not increase your chance of snoring. First, if you eat dinner early in the evening, you reduce the chance it will contribute to snoring. Lobster or scallions are recommended for not inducing snoring. It is believed that they help to reduce and even eliminate snoring by toning the trachea. There are others that are also considered to be snoring-friendly foods including mustard greens, pears, thyme, horseradish, onions, garlic, leeks and seaweed.

Making changes to your lifestyle and diet are not simple things to accomplish and require discipline and the desire for meaningful change. Smoking, drinking alcohol and eating fatty foods can be among the hardest things for a person in our society to give up, and many may think the sacrifice is not worth the reward. With snoring as a strong indicator of being overweight and having a sleep disorder, the rewards of a lifestyle change are well worth the effort. Your sleep-deprived partner will also thank you.
