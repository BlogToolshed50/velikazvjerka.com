The internet today has created unlimited money making opportunities for many online users, some starting with zero or limited knowledge soaring to success in making money online. There is a good number of internet companies today offering genuine online business opportunities. But why does only a handful succeed while the majority jump from opportunity to opportunity without success?

The missing link according to some of the online and offline businesses is in personal development, the motivation to identify, set and to systemically follow up your goals. 

It’s said that everyday we choose what to do with our time. And that every little action that we are involved in, will produce results, whether desirable or otherwise. However, this is not news for most of the people who have been and are still trying to get out of the rat race by investing their time and money in businesses. 

Most of us have been to seminars, have taken notes and have books and audios by the ‘gurus’ of self-improvement, all this without any long lasting favored outcomes. And we keep stacking up more ad more of the personal development materials as we continue to ‘buy hope’ that one day we will find the right program for us.
