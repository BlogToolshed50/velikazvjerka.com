Great thinkers of the past and the present have known that everything in this universe is made of energy. You, me, your computer, your chair, your table are all minute particles of energy pulsating at different speed. Some appears solid because they are denser form of energy and thus move a little slower than liquids which are less dense and vibrates a little more faster giving them a fluid motion.

Objects appear separate and distinct because of this differences in vibrations, but as a matter of particles we are all one and interconnected with each other. What we perceive as another object has actually a connection to our being. There is actually oneness of being.

Have you ever been in a situation where someone is staring at you behind your back and for some reason you turn to look behind you? Our invisible connection with another person becomes more obvious when there is a close relationship existing between us. Some people have recounted their experiences of feeling of impending doom or unexplained anxiety over loved ones who are actually in real danger at that very moment.

Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has preserved me from feeling isolated. -Albert Einstein

For myself, I have experienced countless of times when I suddenly think of a friend and he/she will text me later that day. Just the other day I was wondering how a certain friend of mine was doing. Our busy schedules have not permitted us to see each other or even communicate through text messages. That afternoon I accompanied another friend to a fast food and there was the friend I was just thinking about that morning. She greeted me first by saying, &#8220;Hi, I have been wondering how you are!&#8221;

Coincidence of course! But that is how this works!  <img src='http://www.velikazvjerka.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />
