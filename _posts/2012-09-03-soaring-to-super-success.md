Action signified by ones effort is the real key to one&#8217;s success as well as happiness. There is no success and resultant happiness without action. Action or effort may not sometimes produce the desired result but happiness and success can never come without action or effort.

What is more you can derive satisfaction and happiness in having done your best even though the results did not turn out to be as expected or desired. That is why it is said in the Gita, &#8221; Do your duty unmindful of the results!&#8221;

No man can cope to have a very easy life and also at the same time a very successful one. The rewards one gets in life are usually commensurate with the effort one puts in. It is astonishing what intelligent effort can accomplish when channelized in the right direction. Success is not easy if it was, everyone would be successful. However the success ladder is not as difficult to climb as it might seem. Each time we overcome an obstacle or solve a problem, the task we are attempting becomes easier, till finally what once looked impossible becomes routine. Countless efforts by themselves, despite countless falls, imply the power to rise.

One of the ingredients that makes for success is hard work. But if you like and love your work, you will never find it hard or tiring or boring, no matter how long you happen to be at it. There is no substitute for hard work.

Any Knowledge you may acquire, any skill you may develop will be the result of consistent effort. No point in deluding yourself that success can be had easily or cheaply. Of course Hard Work is not the sole or only ingredient in the recipe for success. There should be a purpose to all work and a worthy goal at which to aim and advance. You must decide what you want the most in your life and then work for it.

When we are at the bottom of the ladder, the top seems inaccessible and the obstacles to the top insuperable. But they are not. The early conquests are the toughest. The more you succeed the easier it becomes to do so till eventually success grows into a habit. Thus, success follows success. Nothing is impossible for a man with a purpose and the perseverance to persist with it. The world stands aside to let pass the man who knows whether he is going and who steps out with confidence, courage and firm determination.

Our hero Saurav Ganguly is a shining example of a man endowed with ample amount of courage to fight against all odds and perseverance in the face of adversity. In the recently concluded Test series against South Africa, he showed nerves of steel. And when the best were struggling against the hostile bowling of the South African pace battery, he stood his ground &#8211; he was out to prove everybody wrong. And he did it in style &#8211; he scored the highest number of runs for India, leaving behind such illustrious teammates as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. All of us are wondering how it all happened. Well he did not have any magic band; all he had was his steely resolve to be amongst the best and to play the game which he eats, drinks and sleeps. Therefore go over, go under, go around or go through, but never give up.

Concentration and determination can enable us to attain success in any field. Success is not a matter of luck or genius, it depends on adequate preparation and indomitable determination. Genius, that power which dazzles mortal eyes, is oft but perseverance in disguise.

Helping you to lead and succeed&#8230;..
