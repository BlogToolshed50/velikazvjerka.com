Seriously impressed with Spider-Man and his wall climbing skills, then wall climbing is what you should do next. Started as a fun activity wall climbing has now taken a shape of professional sports where the rock climbers get their hand on experience before climbing a real one. Professional or Amateur wall climbing is now favored as a perfect indoor adventure activity which rushes adrenaline with the sheer joy and technique which requires both strength and flexibility. Climbing the wall is now a popular activity amongst the young and adventure lovers.

The best part of wall climbing is that you can have the adventure going on with utmost safety and inside your home or in your backyard. A climbing wall is a standard wall made of brickwork or in some cases hard plywood which is made according to standard designs with holds to climb or descend. With proper safety gear wall climbing is the safest adventure activity wherein you can crawl the ceiling of your home as well. You can build the climbing wall with little efforts and a good budget or if you don’t want to use either you can simply rent the wall for your use.

If you have decided to have your own climbing wall you need to know a few important aspects of it. A climbing wall just isn’t complete without adding an assortment of basic climbing wall holds. Holds are what your feet and hands “hold” onto so that you can advance upwards as well as descend. The wall climbing holds are available in vibrant colors, pastels, and shades of swirling grays that actually look and feel like real granite rock outcrops. In all basic climbing wall holds definitely separate the good climbing walls from the great ones!

It is important to clarify when you’re purchasing basic climbing wall holds is whether or not your holds come equipped with t-nuts, bolts and screws. If they don’t, you will have to purchase the hardware separately, that may incur more cost to the built-up. Something else to consider is the wall degree the holds have been designed to accommodate. For example, if you’re outfitting your 45 degree steep overhang, you definitely want to be sure the holds are designed for this. Usually you’ll find that basic rock climbing holds are sold in multi-piece kits, with each kit containing a differing number of mixed sizes and colors. Sizes range from very small dime-sized holds to extra large. Some holds are ergonomically designed and these offer a more comfortable grip. Some holds are manufactured with a coating of UV protectant so that they can withstand the outside elements. Consider purchasing stainless steel hardware if the holds will be used outdoors which are more durable and don’t whether out. Get going with the wall holds and experience the thrill of wall climbing in your own backyard.
