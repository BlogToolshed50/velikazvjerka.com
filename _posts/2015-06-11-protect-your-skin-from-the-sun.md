By now you probably think you&#8217;ve heard all of the health reasons there are for eating your vegetables. But recently, researchers from Harvard University have announced a potent antioxidant found in such dark green, leafy vegetables as spinach and kale &#8212; may protect the skin from sun damage.

&#8220;Lutein has been widely recognized for its eye health benefits for several years. But, our data is the first of its kind to suggest that may have the potential to act as a preventative agent against UVB-induced skin cancer,&#8221; said Salvador Gonzalez, M.D., Ph.D., leader of the Harvard research team. &#8220;In addition, these data suggest that it protects the skin against damage caused by exposure to UVB light, further validating our position that is a critical component to overall skin health.&#8221;

It is a yellow pigment (the yellow is covered up by chlorophyll in green leaves) found predominantly in vegetables. It is also present in the eyes and skin of the human body. In women is found in the breasts and cervix. As an antioxidant, it protects the eyes from the damaging effects of aging. It also acts as a light filter, protecting against the sun&#8217;s harmful rays.

UVA and UVB rays are two types of harmful rays found in sunlight. UVA rays contribute to wrinkling the skin, as well as to the development of skin cancer. UVB rays are the ones that are the primary cause of sunburn and skin cancer.

Good sunscreens block both UVA and UVB rays and are critical to skin health. But, you can do even more to protect your skin and eyes when you&#8217;re outside.

Safety tips to keep top of mind:

* Wear UV-blocking sunglasses. Over time, exposure to ultraviolet light can cause cataracts and increase your risk of macular degeneration, a disease that causes irreversible blindness.
      
* If you&#8217;re a parent, protect your child&#8217;s skin. Research indicates that one or more severe, blistering sunburns in childhood or adolescence can double the risk of skin cancer later in life.
      
* Check the expiration date on your sunscreen. Sunscreen without an expiration date has a shelf life of no more than three years.
      
* Eat a healthy diet comprised of green leafy vegetables. Consumption of 6 milligrams per day (approximately one-third cup of cooked spinach) has been linked to a reduced risk of cataracts and age-related muscular degeneration. Vitamins and dietary supplements formulated with purified it provide another option for adding this nutrient to a daily diet. 

It&#8217;s important to note that when it is consumed in foods or vitamins, it deposits in various tissues in the body &#8212; the eyes, the skin, fat tissue and so on. Therefore, it may also be beneficial to apply directly to the surface of your skin.
