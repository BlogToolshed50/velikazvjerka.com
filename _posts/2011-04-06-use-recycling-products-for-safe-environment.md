Recycling is the talk of the environmentalists in the matter of using various materials in the life. If only the materials are recycled there can be saving in the energy and the environment is also taken care of without much damage. For example, it is estimated that when the used paper is recycled to produce fresh paper it saves as much as 80% of the water that is used otherwise. Likewise the recycled glass saves 50% of the energy that is consumed. Plastic wastes if recycled the waste accumulation can be reduced to a great extent.
