Birding tours are a great way for bird watchers from all over the country to gather together and share their passion of birding.

If you have ever been on a tour before you know what I mean. If you haven&#8217;t, but are wanting to in the future, here are some tips to keep in mind.

You can find birding tours being offered by many different companies to literally anywhere around the world. Some of these companies even have specific tours for those who have experience and those who do not. This can be very helpful for those in either group.

You can also find companies such as &#8220;Exotic Birding&#8221; that offer a photo combination tour of birds and nature.

Of course, some of the most exotic birding tours take you to remote destinations like the Amazon rain forest, African safari, Antarctica or Alaska and other amazing locations.

Imagine being able to bird watch in the rain forest. Can you just hear those incredible sounds from the various types of birds? Talk about a lifetime dream!

You will find that most all of these tours will be led by an experienced bird guide from that particular area. This means that the person will have an extensive knowledge of the birds in that area that they can share with you.

When booking any birding tour, be sure to check the itinerary. What is included? What is the daily schedule? How long have they been providing tours? Finding a solid, reputable company will be your best bet.

Another tip is to choose the time you plan on going on your trip carefully. This could make a huge difference in how many different birds you will have the opportunity to see.

Birding tours are available year round and make for a great get away. Having been on them myself, I can tell you that you will not be disappointed.
