River linking is a major aspect that is discussed in every nation where the water source has become critical. Water derived during rainy season is drained into the sea in a major quantum without any use from the down flowing rivers. If such rivers are linked with each other the wastage of water can be prevented and also out into the best use both for irrigation and industrial use. Added to that the ill effects of such flood is also thwarted. Though the investment is on the higher side in the initial stage the benefit that is to be reaped is enormous at a latter date.
