Did you know that there are approximately 7,000,000 RVs on American roads today, which include motor homes, travel trailers, folding camping trailers, truck campers and van conversions. If you&#8217;re one of the many folks getting ready to take a trip in your RV or Camper and want to be sure to arrive at your destination safely and confidently, plan ahead with the use of a GPS (Global Positioning System), as it guarantees a reliable, simple navigation experience.

The Latest GPS Technology
  
Although keeping up with the latest technology is sometimes a daunting task, choosing the right GPS system can make the travel experience more enjoyable. But what exactly is GPS?

* GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that guarantees a trip that leads straight to your destination.

* A GPS system offers weather and traffic information so that you&#8217;re always prepared

* A GPS system guarantees your safe and timely arrival at your destination of choice, more easily and with a lot more fun.

In-car navigation has never been easier or more affordable, but when shopping for a GPS system, there are a number of differences regarding details and features, which may encompass landmarks, trip histories, environmental conditions as well as speed and accuracy of calculations. Given that hand helds are becoming more popular, when choosing the right hand held GPS for your needs, consider the following tips.

* For more accurate calculations look for a unit with a 12 channel parallel receiver system; the more channels, the more satellites will be able to pick up calculations

* When choosing a GPS Receiver used primarily in your vehicle, built-in road maps are essential.

* Portable GPS&#8217;s come in many shapes and sizes and are highly durable, waterproof and shockproof, plus portable GPS&#8217;s can operate from a cigarette lighter or on batteries.

Whether you&#8217;re camping or driving, GPS products make the entire trip easy, enjoyable and always on track.
