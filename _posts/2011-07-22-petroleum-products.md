Bio fuel is being produced as an alternative to the petroleum products like diesel and petrol. Since the cost of crude oil has gone up to the level near 100 USD per barrel, the nations like the USA who consume more has gone to the production of bio fuel. Mainly corn is used to produce the bio fuel thus creating shortage of food materials as alleged world over. It is high time that an alternative raw material is found to generate bio fuel. Bio wastes can be thought of for usage in producing the bio fuel.
