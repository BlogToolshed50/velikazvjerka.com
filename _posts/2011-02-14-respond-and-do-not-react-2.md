Every one of us needs to learn the difference between &#8220;Responding&#8221; and &#8220;Reacting&#8221; Whenever we encounter unsettling situations in our life, we can deal with it in two different ways for the behavioral experts. We can either Respond or React to it. A Reaction is instinctive and often instantaneous. As a human being, we tend to react while giving little or no thought to the actual circumstances. On the contrary, Responding involves an actual assessment of the situation so that we can make an informed and well thought of decision to tackle that particular situation. Living in heaven is all about respecting and valuing those around us by responding to their calls rather than reacting .

I was so impressed with the quote seen elsewhere that &#8220;Life is Ten percent of what happens to us and Ninety percent how we respond to it&#8221; Hence responding to a situation assumes greater importance for a happy and peaceful life. It sounds funny when the legend Mark Twain gave way for the person who accosted him in a bridge who said that he never gives way for fools while Mark responded saying that &#8220;he gives&#8221;. Thus, the response is precious than the reaction whenever we face the various provoking situation. I only wonder, if every one of us realizes this simple philosophy in our life, we may live in heaven forever.
