Cornea is an important part of the Eye. The other vital parts are, lens and the retina. Cornea is a transparent film like membrane through which the light passes. If the cornea is affected and damaged it leads to the blindness in many people. Replacement of cornea is now attempted by the medical world. A Doctor in Japan has developed an artificial layer which constitutes the cornea and it is under-test. If it is successful, then many people will get backed their eye sight easily. Now they have to wait for the people who donate their eye after death.
