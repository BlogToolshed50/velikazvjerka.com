1. Eat smaller more frequent meals &#8211; not only is your metabolism boosted every time you eat something, your body can more efficiently process smaller meals. Instead of having 3 large meals in a day, try to break them up into 5 or 6 smaller meals.

2. Drink more water &#8211; regular water intake helps to flush away waste products in the body. Get at least six to eight 8 oz. glasses per day. An easy way to do this is to keep a water bottle handy and drink from it frequently.

3. Be inefficient &#8211; do you need to go to the kitchen to get a couple of things? Break it up into to two trips even if you can do it in one. Being inefficient like this can easily double your activity level, burning calories without even trying.

4. Eat more protein &#8211; sources of protein include foods such as chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, lean red meats, etc. Your body burns more calories processing protein than either carbohydrates or fats. Protein also helps to support your muscle tissue, which burns calories all day long!

5. Take the stairs instead of the elevator &#8211; any time you can add in a little more physical activity, do it. This doesn&#8217;t mean you need to slog up 20 flights of stairs. Even a flight or two done regularly will add up. 

6. Don&#8217;t let yourself get hungry &#8211; when you get hungry you will have a much greater tendency to overeat when you do finally get something to eat. As well, because your body is starting to go into starvation mode, it will be much more likely to hold onto whatever you give it.

7. Order small portions at restaurants &#8211; it&#8217;s tough to order small french fries when &#8220;super sizing&#8221; your order is such a great &#8220;value.&#8221; Take note, however, your real savings will occur in the calories that don&#8217;t end up on your backside.

8. Eat more fiber &#8211; fiber is very filling. By eating more fiber you will find yourself full sooner. This feeling of fullness will last a long time as well.

9. Wait 20 minutes between servings &#8211; your brain takes at least 20 minutes to register that you&#8217;re full. By waiting that long, you&#8217;ll give your brain a chance to realize that you don&#8217;t really need any more food.

10. Cheat on your diet &#8211; one thing I always make my clients promise is that they will cheat on their diet. The only thing I ask that they do is to cheat ONLY when they have planned to cheat. By planning when you are going to eat the foods you crave, you take back control of your eating habits. 

This way you no longer &#8220;give in&#8221; to your cravings. You &#8220;reward yourself&#8221; for sticking to proper nutritional habits. Do this once or twice a week and you will feel far more in control of your eating. 

In conclusion, if you follow even a few of these 10 easy tips in the long term, you will certainly notice a difference in your overall weight and health.
