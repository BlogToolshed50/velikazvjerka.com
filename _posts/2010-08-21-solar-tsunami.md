When the tsunami occurred few years back people of various Asian countries suffered and the damage done was heavy. Before the world is coming out of the impact, the scientists are warns of a possible solar tsunami which can hit the earth. It is found that the Sun has flung a large cloud of electrically charged particles towards our planet.

This is based on the scientist&#8217;s prediction can happen at any time and the damage to the earth is not ruled out. The satellite picture from NASA&#8217;s new solar dynamic observatory recorded a small solar flare erupting above sunspot 1092 that is almost equal to the size of the earth.

Also the recording by the satellite shows the large filament of cool gas stretching across the Sun&#8217;s northern hemisphere exploding into the space. The explosion is aimed directly towards the earth racing 93 million miles across space based on the report of the scientists.

As we go on exploiting the nature beyond repair, we may have to face different types of Tsunami in the days to come.
