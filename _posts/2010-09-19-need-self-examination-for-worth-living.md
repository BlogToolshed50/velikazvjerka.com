These days there’s a mad rush to be purpose driven and I wholeheartly agree, it is better to be purpose driven than going in reverse or stuck in neutral. However, why would I be content to be just purpose driven and not living my life’s purpose on purpose? I believe the real reason most people are okay with being just purpose driven is because they don’t know how to identify their real purpose for existing or what purpose means when it relates to individuals. If you’re reading this article, this is the day that was created for you to begin living your life with a purpose on purpose.

The (buzz) word purpose can be substituted for a number of words, some of which could be reason, intention, intent, use, idea, objective, aim, function or determination. In my opinion, a purpose is the reason why you exist to fulfill a specific task that only you can fulfill at a specific time and season here on the earth. A purpose should not, but often times are confused with a person’s call. Purpose and call are different. A call is a particular business, occupation, profession or trade. Once again, purpose is your intended reason for being. Most people live out their lives fulfilling their call, not their purpose. They have prepared themselves for a chosen field or profession. Since they do not know their purpose, they work in that field unhappy for many years and retire. They never venture out to find out what makes them happy. I’ve finally mentioned the operative word&#8212;HAPPY, not just purpose!

Although happiness is evident when you are fulfilling your purpose, there are several other key virtues that will accompany happiness. First, how do we begin to find what our purpose is in life? Why are we here? Like everything else in life, finding your purpose, begins with finding and understanding of who you are. Understanding one’s self is a process that most people neglect or choose not to go through. Understanding who you are as well as self-examination and evaluation is the beginning of identifying your purpose. It is important you get a mental picture of what you look like living your purpose now. I believe one of the most powerful forces in the universe is love and another is our ability to choose our own thoughts. A single action is derived from a thought. One of my favorite sayings is, “The me I see, is the me I’ll be.” In other words, I must begin to see myself as I want to be and not as I am. Once you can mentally see yourself living your purpose, those very images and thoughts you have about yourself will began to draw the desired thought patterns and behavior into your life that will produce what you desire.
