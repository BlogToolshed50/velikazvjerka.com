A great shift is in the making: A time for very deep purification and cleansing from the inner core within ourselves and within the Earth up to the outer manifest reality. How this will all play out is our choice.

Many will understand the need for inner and outer focus on unity and love. However, many others will remain under the grip of their programmed old ways and thus experience this world with much fear while focusing on dis-unity.

This is a time where our greatest force shall emerge from its hidden inner recesses as we face our greatest challenge: a transformation and trans-evolution of mankind when our thought processes transmute from a harsh concentration on lack toward a gentler constant awareness of the beauty and unity of all within the ONE that we all are here to manifest.

This is a time prophesied for eons where, in this world created around the notion of polarity, the &#8220;real&#8221; caring and nurturing Female energy is ready to interpenetrate each of our hearts and balance out the Masculine expansive powerful energy that has overtaken alone much of Creation and destabilized it. It is in the balancing and the unity of the two that our inner smiling probable future lays. Please allow this great and sacred energy in, and wish deeply for unity, for in that act lies the path to our happiness and salvation.

All great changes bring about in many much initial resistance, the degree of which will define the course of this Creation for a long time to come.

As many impacting events are about to happen, and even more unfold in the next months and years, often in an accelerated manner, one core issue will emerge as paramount in being the only real question to be asked and the only solution to be had.

&#8220;Where does your passion lay?&#8221;

Does it lay upon a world where all thoughts and common efforts are on com-passion, forgiveness, unity, happiness, and the notion that we are all &#8211; without any exception -connected within the notion of ONE?

Is it your truest desire to unite the parts within yourself, the family without, and our greatest and most beautiful family: mankind?

Or does you passion lay upon events, stories, legends, and philosophies which evoke and trigger separation, elitism, fear, violence, control, gore, and the anti-force to the sacred notion of Unity of all and everything within the One and Only?

Do you want to unify all polarities to usher the proclaimed glorious era, or polarize even more? For this is the only question to be asked.

Please, I beg of you, watch carefully what you invite in your heart.

If you invite within and resonate only with what unites us as one family and therefore exalts life, then the peace of the ONE, wondrous Creation, and life, longer that you can ever imagine, will be yours.

However, if you invite and resonate within upon visions of death, fear, and all that differentiates, divides, and separates us, then war, suffering, insecurity, and death will be yours.

All great spiritual masters came to tell us of this choice and the two ways of seeing the same reality, and some even expressed it in their lives and experiences on purpose, in order for us to understand the consequences.

A glass is either half full or half empty depending on your focus of attention. Both are true at the same time. It is your focus which will determine which path you will experience. You can either focus on what is lacking, or what is wondrous. You can focus on the unity and common thread of all existence, see the spectacular awe-some reality of creation, and experience the miraculous, or focus on what is lacking and then experience nothingness.

Please do not fall into the trap of &#8220;passion&#8221; for death again.

Please fall in love with yourself again, and with all your human brothers and sisters. For all are precious, magnificent, and sacred expressions of the ONE life force flowing through all living things.
