This guest post from Werner Rogers

Everybody loves at least one superhero, but I personally am having trouble just picking one. But once I really think about it, I would have to say that Spiderman is my favorite. This was the first superhero I was ever introduced to as a kid and even as I grew older, I still loved him. I watch all the Spiderman movies on the satellite TV access I ordered from &nbsp;www.tvbydirect.com&nbsp; all the time and they never get boring. Spiderman has some very special powers that help save the people in his community from the bad guys. This very sticky and spider web-like substance shoots out of his hands and attaches to pretty much anything. This helps him move from building to building no matter how high they are and helps him move quickly. He can save one person on one side of town and then travel to another side of town to save another person a few minutes later. I love how when he gets in his Spiderman suit, he immediately transforms both physically and mentally to a man ready to fight whatever comes his way. I love his courage, bravery, and his capability to manage two lives. As with any super hero, Spiderman has some weaknesses. He is not invincible. You stab him in the heart, he will die. He is just like any other human, but I love that about him.
