Sometimes, when it comes to sports, you just get tired of the big guys. You know those people who love it every year when the Red Sox or the Yankees make it to the World Series? Yeah, I&#8217;m not one of them. I&#8217;m the type of guy who likes my sports raw, emotional and surprising. I like hockey, I like football, and I like the idea of being able to watch teams that I normally wouldn&#8217;t get to see. That&#8217;s why my favorite sports network is VERSUS on &nbsp;directtv&nbsp;. Sure, 90% of the time they are either showing rodeo or bass fishing, but when it comes time for major sporting events, they can&#8217;t be beat.

Being a hockey fan, it&#8217;s really VERSUS or nothing. And while people always complain about the fact that the games aren&#8217;t on ESPN, here&#8217;s a fact you won&#8217;t hear a lot: VERSUS does a great job broadcasting hockey. They let the sport speak for itself. While so many other sports network (I&#8217;m looking at you ESPN) try to sensationalize what you see, VERSUS let&#8217;s the power and beauty of hockey speak for itself. Plus, VERSUS also shows Mountain West and Pac 10 football. For anyone who gets tired of &nbsp;SEC&nbsp; and Big 10 football on every other network, you can always rely on VERSUS to have two teams playing that you, gasp, actually care about.
