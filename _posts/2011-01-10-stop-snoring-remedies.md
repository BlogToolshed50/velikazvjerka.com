There are a variety of factors that cause an individual to begin snoring. No matter what the reason, sufferers around the world simply want to know about the best snoring remedies. Restless nights, frequent headaches, an angry spouse and the inability to concentrate are just a few of the results of snoring. 

Stop suffering tonight and start sleeping better. Before electing to drastic surgical methods, try and resolve your snoring problems naturally.

One such method of treating snoring is achieved through the use of a new doctor recommended product, which is named the Sleep Genie. Fittingly titled, this revolutionary anti-snoring device comfortably supports the jaw while keeping the mouth closed during sleep. 

One of the main causes of snoring is believed to be sleeping with your mouth open, which is rectified with the Sleep Genie. Often working in itâ€™s very first use, the Sleep Genie requires no medication or invasive surgery.

If you tend to sleep on your back, stop now. Begin sleeping on your side and, if necessary, use a body pillow against your back to prevent you from turning back over through the night. Many back sleepers suffer from snoring because their airway becomes restricted when the uvula or fatty tissue in the throat relaxes and restricts the airway. 

By sleeping on your side, this will not be as problematic and the vibrating sounds of snoring will not be created by anything rubbing inside the throat as you sleep. In addition to side sleeping, there are specialty pillows that claim to help curb snoring. 

You may also try using several pillows and elevating your head slightly higher as this will help to keep the air passages more clear during sleep.

If neither of these methods appear to work, consider a lifestyle change. If you smoke cigarettes or live with your pet, it may be time to think about allergies. These and many other factors can lead to allergies, including dust. 

There is no way to remove every dust particle in the home, but air purification systems will work wonders in helping to eliminate as much dust as possible. Allergy and sinus sufferers tend to experience more snoring problems due to nasal and throat airway restriction. 

As the tonsils swell or your nose becomes congested, breathing becomes more difficult. Allergy sufferers, or during cold and flu season, individuals may find relief by inhaling steam before going to sleep. The warmth of the steam from hot running water will lessen congestion and allow the individual to breath easier.
