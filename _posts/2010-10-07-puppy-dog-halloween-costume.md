I&#8217;m always fussing at our son for rolling around on the floor all the time with our dalmation after i get him dressed and ready to get out of the door. I always joke around and say that he&#8217;s just another one of our puppies, so he told me that if I thought that that he wants to dress up as a puppy for Halloween.

I thought it was better than him dressing up as something really violent like a lot of little boys like to do. So I started looking up patterns to make him a costume online when I saw &nbsp;www.clearwirlessinternet.com&nbsp; and decided to switch over our internet service to that.

I ended up finding a pattern for a &nbsp;puppy&nbsp; costume that&#8217;s of a cute little dalmation so that will match our own dog. I just hope that our son doesnÕt crawl around on the floor or even worse crawl up to peopleÕs porches when we take him trick or treating. Because thatÕs what he always does when he plays with our dog.
