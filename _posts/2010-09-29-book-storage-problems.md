Some people spend their money on collecting baseball cards or even shoes, but I have a thing for cheesy science fiction paperback books.

When I downsized from a two bedroom apartment that I shared with a roommate to a studio by myself, I knew there were probably going to be some storage issues. So I went on &nbsp;CLEAR Internet&nbsp; and searched for some inspiration as to how to incorporate the books into my apartment&#8217;s decoration in a cool way where it still looked like I was living there instead of my books taking it over.

I got some great &nbsp;bookshelf&nbsp; ideas and decided to take some bookshelves that I had found in some junk stores and inherited from my friends in aparment moves to line a whole wall with them. Because they were all old and I wasnt worried about using them after that, I just lined them up and then nailed them together with anchors holding them to the wall.

I have to say, it does give my apartment a pretty unique look and I&#8217;m loving it. One of my friends said that they even want to do the same thing in their apartment.
