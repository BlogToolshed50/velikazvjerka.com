Creating the serene life you desire is entirely possible. The secret is in knowing that you yourself hold the key to this achievement. Only you have the ability to build your future.

It's not unusual to turn to others to fulfill your needs and wants. Yet unless you realize that you are the one most likely to fulfill your needs, you will never be satisfied with what others provide. 

It is important to detach yourself from a false sense of self. This "mask" is merely a fa√ßade we use in order to feel safe, but it does not reveal who we truly are. In order to live a life of pure joy that is filled with healthy relationships, a strong career, and whatever other attainable goals you desire, it is vital to dive within the deepest layers of your soul and look at the beautiful gift you are. 

Many people are highly intimidated by the thought of becoming attuned with their emotions. But the only person you will ever meet there is you. Feel who you are, be comfortable with yourself, acknowledge and love every aspect of your true nature - even if you meet anger, jealousy, fear, etc. Nourish your heart through the use of aromatic oil, meditation, yoga or journaling. 

Once you discover your true self, accept and appreciate all the facets of your soul. You will radiate pure beauty, confidence, strength and love. Then you will have built the right foundations of a truly joyful future.
