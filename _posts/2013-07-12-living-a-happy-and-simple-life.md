Here are the 7 secrets on how you can live a happy and simple life by Warren Buffet – a man with all the wealth in the world who still believes that happiness lies not with riches but within yourself. You too can start living in a simple yet happy life by following the following secrets of happiness:

Secret #1:
  
Happiness comes from within. &#8211; If you do what you love and love what you do, you’ll naturally be productive.

Secret #2:
  
Find happiness in simple pleasures. &#8211; You can also learn to be happy with the simple pleasures of playing cards with friends, playing with your children or taking a walk in the wilderness.

Secret #3:
  
Live a simple life. &#8211; Keeping up with the Joneses is the worst epidemic among those who should never contemplate that notion in the first place. Less is more.

Secret #4:
  
Think Simply. -
  
If you apply this rule in your life, you can develop clarity and sanity in your thoughts. Life is about simple yet profound choices.

Secret #5:
  
Invest Simply. &#8211; Often, the simplest route will bring you the most riches, and the most happiness.

Secret #6:
  
Have a mentor in life. &#8211; Having a mentor is as important as having a purpose in your life, but having a wrong mentor is as devastating as having a wrong purpose in your life. The mentor has to be someone you can trust. You’ll find that person in your inner circle if you think hard enough.

Secret #7:
  
Making money isn’t the backbone of your guiding purpose; making money is the by-product of your guiding purpose. &#8211; Money should never become the object and end all of your motivation.
