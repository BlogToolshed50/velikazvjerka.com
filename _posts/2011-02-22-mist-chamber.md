Mist chamber is one of the techniques introduced to rear the plants in a controlled climatic condition. This is mainly used in growing the seed plants. The layers that are used as propagating materials are grown in the mist chambers. Furrows are made and drip irrigation system is followed to irrigate the seed plants that are grown here. There is provision to alter and adjust the climate condition like temperature and humidity in the mist chamber. Those seed producing units are having the mist chambers in an extensive area where the commercial production of seed material is undertaken.
