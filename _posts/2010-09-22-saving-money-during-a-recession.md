Recession is a word that fills people with dread and bad visions. It&#8217;s a time people consider bad for finances, a time capable of magically shrinking a dollar&#8217;s value overnight. It also automatically increases the cost of basic living. And where money is a huge concern, people always ask, &#8216;Can I still save for real during a recession?&#8217; The answer is: of course you can. You just need to be wise and creative about the whole thing. Here are ways how:

Buy in bulk.

If there are items in your house that are often in use (paper towels, canned beans, yoghurt, etc.), consider buying in bulk. Many stores offer items in packs, which means you&#8217;ll save money in the long run if you buy them instead of paying for individual items. 

Put off bigger purchases.

A good rule of thumb is, if you can&#8217;t afford it, don&#8217;t buy it. If, for example, you have enough money for a downpayment on a new LCD TV but will have to borrow money off your credit card just to tide you over for the next few weeks, it would be really insane to make a purchase. Wait until you can truly, comfortably afford something. The worst you can do during a recession is not just failing to get money saved but also going into debt.

Practice prevention, not cure.

If you look closely, there are many things you do in your home that are siphoning precious dollars from your wallet. Simple steps such as repairing and maintaining your home and appliances, using more efficient equipment and cutting down on unnecessary consumption can do wonders for your wallet and piggy bank. And what better way to treat a recession than to be prudent?

Earn extra money.

If, after all your efforts, the money you have saved is still not enough, don&#8217;t let recession get the better of you. There are times when your efforts are just not sufficient â€“ mostly because you don&#8217;t earn enough. Instead of asking for a raise that might never occur or waiting for a promotion to drop on your lap, consider finding other means with which to earn (and save) money. 

Consider getting a part-time job, work extra hours, do selling on the side or offer your skills as a freelancer. The extra income you earn, along with your recession-powered money-saving plan, will help you make enough until after the tough times are over.
