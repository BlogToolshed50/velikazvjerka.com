This guest post from Margaret Mills

There are two main advantages of using c&nbsp;circular knitting needles&nbsp;. The first is that you can create round items such as bags or the body of a sweater without any seams. Since many knitters seem to put off finishing once the knitting is done, this can be enough of a reason by itself. The other advantage is that you don&#8217;t have to keep switching from knit to purl. If you are working on a stockinette stitch project, you can just knit all of the stitches when using circular needles.

There are two problems that are commonly experienced when learning how to knit on circular needles, and both of them occur as a result of joining the end of one row to the beginning of the next. The first problem is that if you&#8217;re not careful, your knitting can get twisted when you join the first row and you&#8217;ll have to rip it out and start over. Fortunately, you probably won&#8217;t get through the second row before you notice this, so you won&#8217;t be ripping out much.

The second problem is the development of what looks like a ladder running down the part of the project where the rows join. This is usually the result of stitches that are too loose where the two rows come together. Some people counteract this by knitting the first stitch of each new row very tightly. Another method is to slip the first stitch on the left-hand needle onto the right needle then pass the stitch to the right of it over so it is on the left. The knitting then continues with the next stitch on the left-hand needle. If you don&#8217;t have circular needles yet, you can do what I do: shop online using your &nbsp;clear mobile broadband directtv bundle savings&nbsp; and have them shipped directly to your house.
