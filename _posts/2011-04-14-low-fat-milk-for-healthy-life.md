It may sound little paradoxical, but researchers at Harvard University and Wageningen offer the advice to take three glasses of milk to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by as much as 18%. They have found no link between the practice of taking low fat dairy or milk on regular basis and the heart diseases. In fact, as every one of us, know the milk is found to be the most nutritious food item to add strength and longevity to human life.

The Calcium, Potassium and Protein available in the milk helps you lot to maintain a healthy body. Higher dairy calcium intake can assist you to a greater diet induced weight loss without any hassle as found in the publication of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. the intake of the saturated fat through dairy intake is not leading to the heart related problem as confirmed by many studies.
