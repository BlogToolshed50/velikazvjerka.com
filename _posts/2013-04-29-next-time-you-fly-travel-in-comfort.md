You have arrived at the airport and just checked in. You’re ready to head to the departure gate for what will undoubtedly be a long wait before getting on board your flight. But, what if you could spend this time in the comfort of an airport lounge?

No longer for the exclusive use of travelers who have paid through the nose for business class seats, airport lounges are now available to anyone, no matter how much you paid for your flight. Instead of being one of the added luxuries that bump up the cost of air travel beyond the price most are willing to pay, a lounge can now be added to your travel experience at a very reasonable cost.

All airport lounges include comforts like easy chairs where you can read one of a range of international newspapers and magazines or watch television. If you haven’t got the time to relax prior to your departure, you can use a lounge to get urgent work. Internet connections are available on the computers provided, or you can use your own laptop while also enjoying the use of a fax machine.

Meanwhile, drinks and snacks are included in the price. You can have a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy a soft drink or alcoholic beverage. And once you’ve finished, come back for another drink; only champagne will cost extra on top of the fixed price you pay for use of the airport lounge.

All these services can be used up to 3 hours before departure and in the unlikely event that you get through check-in quicker than expected, the airport lounge you have chosen will likely welcome you even earlier. While everyone else is sweating it out at the departure gate, you’ll be sat comfortably enjoying all the services without needing to leave until your boarding call.

All lounges feature onscreen flight information and boarding calls can be heard over the loudspeaker service. If you fall asleep, you can rely on a lounge attendant to wake you in time for boarding.

Booking an airport lounge as part of your holiday or business trip is even simpler than booking your flight. Get on the internet. Here you will get a full step-by-step guide to arranging your lounge, with up to 130 to choose from at major UK airports and popular destinations abroad.

Firstly, type in your travel dates and times along with the airport you will be flying from to receive a choice of available airport lounges. A breakdown of the services on offer and a quote will appear on your screen. Indeed, the most startling fact about choosing an airport lounge is the low price, especially when you consider the difference between the cost of a budget airline seat and business class ticket.

Like other aspects of the travel business, services are now being sold individually, meaning that the price you are paying for each becomes obvious and therefore competitive.

With just a little extra cost added to your flight, you will be able to join business travelers in comfort rather than rub shoulders with other budget passengers prior to take off. Start your trip on a comfortable note and book an airport lounge now.
