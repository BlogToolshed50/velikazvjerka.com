If you are at the point in your life when you feel like you are already too old to pursue the route in finding your passion, stop the thought. No one is too old or neither too young to go where they really want to go. If you will surrender to defeat, you will never know what could have happened if only you have allowed yourself to take risks in order to attain what you heart wants you to. 

Age doesn&#8217;t matter when it comes to pursuing what will make you feel complete. This is necessary so that when you finally cannot muster strength to move forward, you can always look back at your achievements with fulfillment in your heart. 

Some people never get the chance to look back. Once they feel like they are already settled in the environment that they have chosen to be in, they fear that they will lose everything if they will let it go to pursue something that they are not really sure what the outcome will be. So they decide to stay in the place where they are even though they feel like they are stuck with it. If you are doing something that you don&#8217;t really like, you will feel like life is dragging you to do things. You are creating your own prison where you are making calculated moves and you know exactly what to do whenever anything goes wrong.

Once you get too comfortable with this scenario, you will likely be afraid to come out of it. So you have to take a risk before you get into such state. If you will allow yourself to be a prisoner of that situation where you are being driven by money, you will find it to go back to the point when you have promised your passion that you will get back at it. That promise is important because you owe it to yourself to make this happen. This way, once you are old and you have accomplished so much, you will see light on what really matters if you have followed your guts to lead you in fulfilling your dreams.

Finding your passion can still be achieved even if you are already old. You just have to set your heart and mind to it to be able to attain your goals.
