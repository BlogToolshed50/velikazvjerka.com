In the space, each and every nation is trying to take part in exploitation by sending various satellite and space shuttles. The debris created by such objects is increasing day by day in the space and the size vary from 0.5mm to the size of a bus. It is estimated that around 200,000 such objects are floating in the space as the remains of the rockets, space shuttle and other equipment sent to the space.

The presence of such particle pose a great danger to the newly sent rockets and the shuttles. An Australian company has come out with a solution for this issue. They have developed a laser tracking system to stop the debris from colliding with the space crafts and the satellites. The lasers fired from the earth can locate and track the debris protecting the objects sent to the space.

The technology has been developed with an investment of $3.5mn by the company named Electric Optic Systems in Australia. Let us hope that this will help to protect the human being from being hit by such flying articles at the speed of about 30000 kph., in the space.
