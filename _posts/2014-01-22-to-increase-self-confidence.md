So you are looking into ways and techniques to enable you to gain confidence and increase self-esteem. Well guess what? You have come to the right place as in this article I will be providing free tips and advice about this very subject, I hope you enjoy the read.

I spent the first twenty-two years of my life having to cope with a stutter. This as you may imagine had a major, negative, impact on my overall self-esteem and self-confidence. I was constantly accepting second best in life and was often in a depressed state of mind. I was less than impressed with the hand of cards that I had been dealt and was full of self pity. I believed, in my negative way, that I would struggle at the dating game, I would struggle to forge a successful career and that I would therefore have a rather unhappy future. What was the point? Where was the hope? Why should I get out of bed in the morning? These were questions that I asked myself on a regular basis. I became in a form of rut and could see no way out.
  
It was not until my early twenties that I was to emerge out of this negativity. No longer was I going to accept second best, no longer was I going to be a depressive, no longer was I going to fear social situations and no longer was I going to be a loner.

So what was the catalyst to my new found strength? Well alcohol of all things is the answer to this question. I had been drinking alcohol on a regular basis since the age of around sixteen. When intoxicated I could speak as fluently as the next man, I was happy, I was fearless, I was confident and I was care-free. Now do not worry the solution to your confidence and self-esteem issues is not to become drunk every night but what had this experience with alcohol taught me? Well quite simply it showed me that I was able to speak fluently and that I could be happy.

I just had to live life when sober as I did when I was drink. For example I had to learn to be far more positive, far more care-free and far more stress-free. I am worthy, I am a nice person and I am clever.

I have also now realized that I have actually been dealt a very good hand of cards, I am one of life&#8217;s lucky ones. Here&#8217;s to the future!
