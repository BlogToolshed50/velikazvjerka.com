Establishing and maintaining a garden requires a basic set of knowledge. Mother Nature insists that certain rules be followed and the gardener must work with Mother Nature to help plants grow, bloom and produce fruit abundantly.

The new e-book &#8220;Gardening Made Easy&#8221; at our web site will teach you all the basics you need to know to create a beautiful garden. Here&#8217;s an overview of the gardening basics every gardener needs to know.

The Bones of the Garden

The walkways, patios, decks and borders, along with trees, buildings and different planting areas make up the bones of the garden. Working with the existing elements and adding to the structure will enhance the overall appearance and practicality of your garden.

Planting Zones

Planting zones have been established using the average minimum winter temperatures in each geographical area. When choosing plants for your garden spot, the gardener must know which plants will survive in an outdoor garden in that area.

Mulch

Mulch is much more than just a decorative dressing. Mulch protects the soil from the sun&#8217;s damaging rays, helps the soil retain moisture and helps prevent weeds. Mulch can also protect your plants from freezing.

Watering Guidelines

Too much water can damage your garden just as much as too little water. Watering incorrectly can damage your plant&#8217;s roots and even kill tender seedlings. Watering deeper and less often will help your plants establish deeper stronger root systems.

A Quick Overview of Fertilizers

Commercial fertilizers all contain three basic ingredients:

1. Nitrogen for new foliage and overall plant growth
  
2. Phosphorus for a healthy root system
  
3. Potassium for the development of blooms and fruits

Fertilizers come in dry, soluble and time-release forms, giving the gardener choices in how quickly the fertilizer is absorbed and a choice in the strength of the solution to be applied.
