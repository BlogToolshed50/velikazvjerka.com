During the time of Green Revolution period, the use of chemical fertilizers assumed the center point, to increase the crop production. But the damage done to the soil by continued usage of the inorganic manures is felt now by everyone around the world.

The agricultural scientists and the soil specialists are driving home the point to the farming community to go in for the balanced use of chemical fertilizers along with the green manures. But it is pertinent to adhere to their advice as the production level is drastically coming down in many pockets of the world due to the indiscriminate use of the inorganic manure.

The traditional leguminous green manures grown in the field and ploughed in situ helps the crops to fix the nitrogen from the atmosphere and enrich the soil wealth. These leguminous crops contain the Nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria in their root portion which can easily fix the atmospheric nitrogen. It is high time that we should think of the green manures to preserve the soil wealth and improve the agricultural production.
