Working to become a better you can cut down anxiety and panic attacks. Things that create stress are called stressors. Stressors can happen outside of you or in your mind. For something to be stressful, the event must be threatening to you in some way. Usually a stressor is threatening when it will have a big impact on you. It is important to know that stressors are the leaders of stress, and often target us each and every day.

It is not uncommon that people are the main creator of stressors. They are constantly pulling you away from your daily plans and goals, just to talk, wanting you go out with them, or other disruptive tasks and sometimes chores. Remember that you are working toward a future that you will live and be happy in. Thus, asserting self and standing up and fighting to reach your goals is ultimate in bettering you and getting rid of anxiety and panic.

Taking action is the process of bettering self for a successful future. When you take action, you will find it easier to remove stressors. I could spend a lifetime yelling each time I allowed someone to take control of my life, but instead, I control my own life and have no problem letting anyone know it. Of course, things come up we must deal with that interferes and interrupts our lives, however dealing with it now can put an end to the problem later.

Stressors are nasty little critters that work for us or against us. If you learn to minimize stressors you will have a friend, since when stress steps in, you will rarely feel anxious or panic. Now take the test to find out how you deal with stress.

Do you place high emphasis on small problems making them bigger? If you answered yes, then you need to check your mind carefully before jumping to conclusions.

Do you often place high importance on insignificant issues? Do you disassociate from inconsequentiality, i.e. do you let the little things go? If you answered yes to one then learn what is important to you. If you said yes to the second question then you are working to better self, since you are not sweating the small stuff.

Asking questions and searching for answers can help you to avoid stressors, overwhelming stress, anxiety and panic. Once you ask questions and seek out answers, you will grow into resourcefulness, which is a healthy state of mind.

Resourcefulness enables you to use ingenuity and imagination while learning inventiveness. You will find originality, which is a high commendable quality that we all seek.

Imagine you in the next few weeks feeling better about self. Imagine self-smiling, feeling good, and not fearing anxiety and panic. Keep going while telling you that from now on I intend to work toward a better me. I am not going to allow stressors, stress, anxiety and panic to control my life. Now, imagine self-doing it, while planning actions and steps to achieve your newfound goal to a better you.
