Reaching for a mid-afternoon candy bar instead of ripe fruit or raw vegetables can have serious consequences on our physical &#8211; and emotional health. According to a recent survey, 70% of Canadians are not getting the recommended five to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables in their diet. As a result, poor eating habits are making Canadians &#8220;hormonally&#8221; unhealthy.

Poor eating habits not only have a serious impact on our overall health, energy levels and immune system, but the wrong food choices can be emotionally draining too, according to Sam Graci, nutritional researcher and author of the new book &#8211; The Food Connection: The Right Food at the Right Time.

Eating refined or processed carbo-hydrates, which are high in fat, salt, sugar or artificial sweeteners sends insulin levels soaring and throws our hormones off balance. Too much of the insulin hormone slows down the growth hormone (GH) which controls our sense of well-being. It also increases the amount of the stress hormone cortisol in the body, which speeds up the aging process.

But you can eat your way to healthy hormones. Next time you have the munchies or that mid-afternoon craving, reach for ripe, colorful fruits, vegetables, a handful of nuts or seeds, or a nutritional supplement such as greens+â„¢ &#8211; all of which are packed with phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals the body needs to stay healthy and keep hormone levels &#8211; stress, energy and moods &#8211; in check

It&#8217;s not only what you eat that will keep your hormones balanced &#8211; consider when you fuel up. Eating five small meals a day &#8211; three meals and two snacks &#8211; will help avoid the peaks and valleys of moods that can accompany big meals. Avoid skipping meals and waiting more than three and a half hours in between meals since this will zap our energy hormones and spoil our mood.

To help jump-start your energy hormones and promote mental clarity, start each day with greens+, a nutritional supplement and balanced formula of 23 premium quality, natural herbs, vitamins, minerals, organic and nutrient-rich foods.

Be sure to eat a balance of Carbo-hydrates, protein and fat in all three meals. About 55% of our total daily calories should come from carbohydrates, 25 % from protein and 20% from fats. Breakfast and lunch should include the highest amount of lean protein, such as fish or chicken in order to stockpile nutrients for the day ahead. Throughout the day, the amount of protein eaten should be reduced gradually, and replaced by complex carbohydrates such as fruit and vegetables, leafy green salads and whole grains. To help maintain hormonal balance at the end of day, try to eat dinner before 7:30 p.m. Eating too much protein and not enough complex carbohydrates at dinner can make for a restless night&#8217;s sleep.
