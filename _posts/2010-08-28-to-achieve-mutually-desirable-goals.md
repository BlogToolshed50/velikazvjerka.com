A work with passion is a work that expresses love. This love is not the romantic love but the love that is conduit to expressing goodwill to others and the community and yet you get paid at the same time. When your work is one that spread the love to others, you feel prouder of yourself. To find passion at work, you can re-examine your roles and how it contributes for greater work. Then, remind yourself of those thoughts every now and then. 

Some fears are born from abuses and mistreatment we have received from our parents, teachers, former employers, co-workers and other people. These fears oftentimes restrict us to become completely happy and passionate about our work. A lot of people feel empty because they are guilty of the past. They feel there is no possibility of finding the work they love and thus, they only give half of their hearts to it. Finding your passion at work also means letting go of the monsters of the past. When you liberate yourself from negative thoughts out of unpleasant past experiences, you will become more open to experiences that will transform you to a more mature individual â€“ someone that is willing to accept responsibility of changing her life thru her own hands and cooperate with positive people to achieve mutually desirable goals.
