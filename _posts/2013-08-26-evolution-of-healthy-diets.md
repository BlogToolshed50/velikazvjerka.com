First there is S.A.D. (Standard American Diet). This diet makes people fat and sick. This is a generalization. Not everyone on this diet for a long time is fat and sick. But America is the fattest country in the world. Also the U.N. (United Nations) ranked the USA as the unhealthiest (sickest) country out of 100 countries that they examined.

Then there is the vegetarian diet. All plant foods have plenty of fiber unless it is taken out like they do with refined wheat and white rice. Animal foods have no fiber. Fiber keeps your colon clean and healthy reducing your chances of cancer and cardiovascular problems. Four thousand studies show that fruits and vegetables prevent cancer. Meat encourages the growth of cancer.

The Chinese eat mostly plant foods and have a much lower rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease than Americans do. Plant foods have a lot of unsaturated fat while meat has a lot of saturated fat. Usually unsaturated fats are healthier for you than the saturated fats. Some vegetarians eat eggs and dairy products. Dairy products create sinus and respiratory problems. Since cookies and candy bars are vegetarian, people can eat a very unhealthy vegetarian diet. The basic rule to eating healthy is to eat foods made by God or nature and avoid foods made by man that are designed to make you fat and addicted to food since that is best for their business.

Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, Socrates and Pythagoras were vegetarians. Current vegetarians include Brad Pitt, Pamela Anderson, Dustin Hoffman, Kate Winslet, William Shatner, Avril Lavigne, Paul Newman, Chelsea Clinton (daughter of President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton), Paul McCartney, Shania Twain, Paul Newman, Drew Barrymore, Clint Eastwood and Allysa Milano.

Then there is the more restrictive vegan diet that Natalie Portman and Alicia Siverstone follow. This means eating no animal products including dairy products. Then there are even more restrictive diets than this. One is the fruitarian diet where people eat only fruit. This includes foods that come from the reproductive system of the plant like nuts, seeds, eggplant, cucumbers, squash, tomatoes and more. With this diet, no plants are killed or harmed. The diet that is popular now is the raw food movement. Raw foodists eat only raw food or mostly raw food and this food is also vegan food.

This diet is close to how animals eat. But there is a diet that is just like what the animals use. The animals know what is good for them by instinct. How does it work? They just eat whatever tastes good. Humans also have this instinct. They eat raw food and whatever tastes good is good for them. This way you do not need to worry if the oxalic acid in spinach prevents the absorption of calcium or if oranges are bad for people with certain blood types and all that nonsense. This is why babies are always putting things in their mouth. Their instinct will tell them if it is good for them. Note that man can make rat poison that tastes like healthy food but kills the rat. So eating the foods that tastes the best does not include foods altered or cooked by man.

Put raw poisonous mushrooms (toadstools) in your mouth and you will spit them out since they taste so bitter. But if they are cooked, you can eat them and die. So if you are stranded in the woods with no food, you can use this to find good food to eat. It is possible to overeat raw foods when they are mixed together. But animals in nature eat only one food at a time. If you do this, then you will never overeat a food. You will not want any more when you have had enough. This is how the animals eat. Also this applies to any raw food even if it is not vegetarian.

This diet is called the instinct diet. People on this diet will try eating anything raw. It could be that many of the benefits of eating raw food comes from not eating any (or very little) salt. Salt is not a food. Put 3 ounces of salt in water and drink it and you will die. Salt causes water to not be able to work. That is why you can die of dehydration being on a raft in the ocean surrounded by billions of gallons of water. Vitamins and minerals have a minimum R.D.A. (recommended daily allowance). But sodium has a maximum R.D.A.

Kevin Trudeau (author of Natural Cures) believes that the raw food diet is the healthiest diet but he does not follow it now. He says that some day he may follow it. There are health experts that are against eating 100% raw. But (and this is a big but) they don&#8217;t suggest what percentage of raw food is best, whether it be 95% or 5%.

These diets and certain foods can act as incredible natural cures for different health challenges.
