We have all wasted precious working hours, sometimes frantically looking for an article or business letter saying &#8220;that&#8217;s where it was last time&#8230;.i think&#8230;&#8221;

Sometimes i used to think i was getting alzhiemers before i was 40!! lets face it, time is money and we only have so much of both. Besides, the last thing you need to be worrying about is locating clipart or a tiny 6 line ad. The fact still remains, you needed it fast!!

Remember when we first had Excel & Lotus 123?, They Were GREAT!! & were we ever organized!!

BUT, as with any good thing, time takes it&#8217;s toll & these programs simply can&#8217;t keep up. We need a better system.

>NO spreadsheet,
  
>NO personal organizer,
  
>NO chart was ever created that works perfect.

They all have something missing you wish you had a space for. Or you end up creating another confusing mess and wasted time doing it &#8230;..hhhmmmmm

Wasn&#8217;t i trying to stop doing just that?

You get the picture now right?

I believe i have found relief with a new program that recently hit the internet BIGTIME, and I&#8217;m also quite certain will be around a very long time. The &#8220;Affiliate Assistant&#8221; HAS ARRIVED !!

This handy little program was MADE just for this purpose and is being hailed as the next &#8221; Industry standard Tool for Affiliates to keep track of all their information&#8221;

Here&#8217;s a few things you can do using The &#8220;Affiliate Assistant&#8221;

>Organize All of Your Affiliate Programs
  
>Enter & store passwords & user names
  
>Contact information list
  
>Insert site addresses (URLS)
  
>Chart & Track ad campaigns
  
>Track Payments Due
  
>Track Payment History

So, how much is your time worth? $50.00hr? $40.00? or $30.00?

If you could it for less than one hour of your time would you seriously consider it? I think you would.
